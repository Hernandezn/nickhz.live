				Micro-project exercise in Node.js
			</h2>

			<h4>
				This exercise is part of a self-study regimen that I'm performing with guidance from the textbook <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke</a>. This project's requirements are detailed under the optional <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/20_node.html#i-TLRTlwK6ZU">final exercise of chapter 20</a>, where all knowledge from throughout the text may be aggregated into a Node.js backend / JavaScript frontend mini-project, before the final project at the end of the textbook. The exercise presumes that I'll directly use code produced earlier the text, but I've instead opted to re-architecture this project and add a few of my own requirements, too.
			</h4>

			<h4>
				At the time of writing, this application only works on a local system with Node.js installed, using the <code>node custom-server.mjs</code> command to run my custom Node.js server script work. In the future, I may adapt it to deploy over cloud infrastructure, as part of a nickhz.live subdomain project, but this will be outside the scope of this exercise.

				Project Requirements
			</summary>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Establish a Node.js HTTP server.
				</li>
				<li>
					Create a front-end Web page (this page) as an initial UI for the application.
				</li>
				<li>
					On the server, create a PUT method that allows a specified file or directory to be created at a specified path relative to the "files/" folder present in this application. NO FILE INTERACTIONS SHOULD BE POSSIBLE OUTSIDE OF THIS FOLDER.
				</li>
				<li>
					On the UI, create a JavaScript fetch connected to HTML elements that allow the PUT endpoint to be hit with input content from the UI.
				</li>
				<li>
					On the server, create a GET method that serves the resource at the specified path whenever it's requested via the URL.
				</li>
				<li>
					On the UI, whenever the home page is retrieved, send a JavaScript fetch to GET the set of all files that are currently in the application so they can be listed.
				</li>
				<li>
					On the UI, set up a structure that communicates the arrangement of folders & files. This structure should reflect the content of the "files/" folder.
				</li>
				<li>
					On the server, set up the PUT response to send an updated file structure to the UI after a file is added.
				</li>
				<li>
					On the UI, ensure that PUT requests update the UI according to the PUT response.
				</li>
				<li>
					On the server, add a DELETE functionality. This should respond with a file structure update and shouldn't be able to delete the "files/" folder.
				</li>
				<li>
					On the UI, ensure that DELETE requests update the UI according to the DELETE response.
				</li>
				<li>
					On the server AND the UI, add EDIT functionality to the applicable file types, which includes both a GET variant for retrieving file content and a PUT variant for writing that data to the file.
				</li>
			</ul>
