 <a href="https://nickhz.live" target="_blank">My personal website</a>'s root domain source code.

 Made from scratch, and includes live CI/CD deployment to AWS.

 This is an independent Web development project. It's got novel coding patterns, experimental Web design, basically pages that don't exist anywhere else on the Web, even as templates! Subdomains are planned to use different technologies & full-stack compositions, but this base site currently uses in-depth vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Why Plain HTML/CSS/JS?

 This is just the start of a bigger project! I want to make sure I'm brushed up on the base technologies before moving onto using external libraries & frameworks, running my own backends, orchestrating Web infrastructure, and (eventually) providing real-world services.
 
 Plus, the base frontend technologies are not only framework-agnostic but supplementary to all the technologies built on top of them. Being better with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript also makes you better with React, Angular, PHP, SCSS, Bootstrap, Svelte, Vue, JSP, and any number of other Web UI technologies (including future ones!).
 
 I also just enjoy creating and trying things out in a freeform environment, and no medium that runs in a browser is more freeform than the base HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
