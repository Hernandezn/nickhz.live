 <a href="https://nickhz.live" target="_blank">My personal website</a>'s top-level-domain source code.

 Made from scratch, and includes live CI/CD deployment to AWS.

 This is a a self-driven independent Web development project employing novel coding patterns and experimental Web design practices. Subdomains are planned to use different technologies & full-stack compositions, but this base site currently uses in-depth vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Why Plain HTML/CSS/JS?

 The base frontend technologies are not only framework-agnostic but supplementary to all technologies built upon them. Being better with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript also makes you better with React, Angular, PHP, SCSS, Bootstrap, Svelte, Vue, JSP, and any number of other Web UI technologies (including future ones!).
 
 I also just creating and trying things out in a freeform environment, and no medium that runs in a browser is more freeform than the base HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
