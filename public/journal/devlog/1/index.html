                    What is this site?
                </h1>

                <p>
                    This site is a collection of experiments and exercises 
                    meant to act as my own creative canvas, as a learning & 
                    brushing-up experience, as a springboard for my next 
                    projects, and as a personal site that solves personal 
                    problems. Do I want a Web page resume? Well, 
                    <a href="professional/resume/">here it is</a>. Do I want 
                    some easy metrics on my browsing devices to help me 
                    develop for them? Well, I just go to 
                    <a href="./?page=device#device-info-tab">my homepage with 
                    the device info tab open</a>. Do I want to jot down what 
                    I'm making so I don't lose track of the next steps I want 
                    to take? That's what I made <a href="wip">the WIP page</a> 
                    for. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I don't plan for it all to be so utilitarian at the end of 
                    the day, because I do have an affection for independent & 
                    retro Web design. However, I am creating this development 
                    log to help me document my process & see what I was 
                    thinking when I made things. If anyone else ever reads 
                    this, I hope you can learn from my experiences.
                </p>

                <h1 id="how-i-made-this-site">
                    How I made this site
                </h1>

                <p>
                    I'm writing this section in the form of a guide. It's been 
                    in my plan to document how I made this site, so I'll be 
                    able to just come back to this page if I want do it again 
                    in the future or adapt parts of this process for something 
                    else.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Putting this website live on the Web required my use of 
                    an account on 
                    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/" target="_blank">Amazon 
                    Web Services (AWS)</a>. I mostly followed instructions 
                    provided by AWS, but my process didn't always happen in 
                    the same order nor to the letter described by AWS, as my 
                    needs varied from the existing process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    USING AMAZON WEB SERVICES REQUIRES A MONTHLY 
                    PAYMENT AFTER THE FIRST YEAR. FOR A SIMPLE STATIC SITE 
                    LIKE THIS ONE, THE PAYMENT WILL BE ON THE ORDER OF 
                    UNDER $15 USD PER MONTH IN ADDITION TO THE INITIAL AND 
                    YEARLY RENEWAL PAYMENT MADE FOR THE WEBSITE NAME 
                    REGISTRATION. IF THIS PAYMENT CAN'T BE MADE, THE SITE 
                    SHOULD NOT BE HOSTED ON AWS.

                        To make the barebones files required for a Web page, I:

                            <li>
                                created a folder on my computer with a descriptive 
                                name (like "example.com")
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                entered that folder and created a file in the

                                with..." before selecting a text editor (like 
                                Notepad or Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code) 
                            </li>

                                entered the following into the file:

                    <p>
                        After saving the file with these contents, I created a 
                        subfolder called "img" and put a 32x32 image in the folder 
                        called "icon.png". After this, I'm done with the most 
                        basic setup of the site's files. You should be able to 
                        open index.html (with a Web browser this time) and see 
                        something like the following:
                    </p>

                    <img src="img/barebones-index.png" alt="barebones index.html file" />

                    <p>
                        This is what will show up on the Web page whenever it's 
                        live on the Web. To add content, there are many 
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank">tutorials</a> 
                        online, from 
                        <a href="https://neocities.org/tutorial/html/1" target="_blank">brief</a>

                        with which you can learn HTML, CSS, and potentially 
                        JavaScript. For now, the page just look like this, 
                        and this document focuses on how I put the site live on 
                        the Web.

                        then instead of filling out the login details right away,

                        the login process. MFA may need to be set up for this, 
                        which should be doable from this page, after entering 
                        login details. I use the mobile "Authenticator" app from 
                        Microsoft.

                    <p>
                        I then do to the "Dashboard" option under the top-left 
                        hamburger menu icon.

                        In the "Register domain" box, I enter a website name 
                        to check if it's available. For instance, 
                        "example.com" won't be available, but at the time of 
                        writing, "example-999.com" will be available:
                    </p>

                    <img src="img/aws-route-53-example-999.png" alt="AWS route 53 showing that example-999.com is available" />

                    <p>
                        If the original name I planned for wasn't available, 
                        I can simply change the name of the folder I created 
                        in my local system in the above steps.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once I select the domain name, I hit "Proceed to 
                        checkout," "Next," and enter my information. This 
                        information is required for the domain name registrar 
                        but is then anonymized as long as I keep the "Privacy 
                        protection" checkbox at the bottom selected. I can 
                        just fill out the "Registrant contact" section and 
                        select "Same as registrant contact" for all the 
                        others. After this, it's a regular checkout process 
                        that'll take your payment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After paying for the domain name, the registration 
                        will take some minutes to complete. During this time, 
                        the next steps can be pursued.

                    <p>
                        I repeat the above steps, but with the bucket name 
                        beginning with "www." (as in "www.example.com"), to

                            the entry, and comparing the "Name servers" entries, 
                            on the right, against the 4 entries that are in the

                            "Value/Route traffic to" column. If there is no such 
                            record, a record of type "NS" must be created with 
                            values matching the name servers of the hosted zone, 
                            plus a period at the end of each (i.e., name server 
                            entry "ns-123.awsdns-99.net" means an NS record value 
                            "ns-123.awsdns-99.net."). If there IS such an entry 
                            but if those entries (besides the last period) don't 
                            match the "Name servers" entries in the hosted zone 
                            details section, select that record (type should be 
                            "NS") using the check box next to the record, hit 
                            "Edit record," and correct the values. If this doesn't 
                            work, the hosted zone may need to be deleted and 
                            re-created.
