                                    <p>
                                        I greet the universe today! <img src="img/ringed-blue-planet.gif" alt="a pure-blue planet with a ring around it" />

                                    <p>
                                        This diary that looks like an actual 
                                        diary is a bit of an experiment. It's 
                                        just a prototype right now, but I 
                                        think I'd like to share the format so 
                                        others can have their own webpage 
                                        diaries, too! That's getting ahead of 
                                        myself, though. Or maybe it's just 
                                        straight to the point...
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        The Web can be a medium of free 
                                        expression, and I want to share that 
                                        with others. It can be fun and 
                                        creative and authentic, it can respect 
                                        the amount of time & attention you 
                                        have, and all parts of it don't have 
                                        to descend into an adware sellout 
                                        culture. I want to share the means to 
                                        pursue a more human vision of the Web 
                                        with others, and I want to do it 
                                        full-time.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        I will likely quit my 4-year job with 
                                        Infosys soon. I learned that I've been 
                                        paid much less than my real worth for 
                                        the work I've done. The people there 
                                        have treated me well enough, but I'm 
                                        already looking at what comes after. 
                                        And that doesn't just mean 
                                        higher-paying jobs. The way I see it, 
                                        I have three options for how I'll make 
                                        ends meet:

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                Make & foster my own 
                                                creations that'll support 
                                                me financially. Low financial 
                                                certainty, high freedom. I'd 
                                                prefer this, and it has  
                                                potential for me to focus my 
                                                energy on something that makes 
                                                the world a little better. 
                                                Meaningful work.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Freelance project commissions. 
                                                Below average financial 
                                                certainty, above average 
                                                freedom. I may do this if my 
                                                own projects aren't panning 
                                                out. Potentially stimulating & 
                                                diverse.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Another job. Financially 
                                                certain, not very freeing. If 
                                                the above aren't working or if 
                                                a loved one's health turns 
                                                dire, I'll put my plans on 
                                                hold and sell my time to pay 
                                                for what matters. Good pay.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>
                                        
                                    <p>
                                        In any case, it's best that I continue 
                                        working. All these options can benefit 
                                        from expanded & up-to-date software 
                                        skills. I've been working on this site 
                                        for the better part of the past week 
                                        now, and it's sort of been what's 
                                        going on in my life. Practicing the 
                                        discipline to work full-time without 
                                        being told to... that's one of the big 
                                        steps to getting where I want to go. 
                                        Let's make it a long & fruitful 
                                        journey.
