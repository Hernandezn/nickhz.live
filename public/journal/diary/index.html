                                    I greet the universe today! <img src="img/ringed-blue-planet.gif" alt="a pure-blue planet with a ring around it" />

                                    This diary that looks like an actual 
                                    diary is a bit of an experiment. It's 
                                    just a prototype right now, but I 
                                    think I'd like to share the format so 
                                    others can have their own webpage 
                                    diaries, too! That's getting ahead of 
                                    myself, though. Or maybe it's just 
                                    straight to the point...
                                </p>

                                    The Web can be a medium of free 
                                    expression, and I want to share that 
                                    with others. It can be fun and 
                                    creative and authentic, it can respect 
                                    the amount of time & attention you 
                                    have, and all parts of it don't have 
                                    to descend into an adware sellout 
                                    culture. I want to share the means to 
                                    pursue a more human vision of the Web 
                                    with others, and I want to do it 
                                    full-time.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    I will likely quit my 4-year job with 
                                    Infosys soon. I learned that I've been 
                                    paid much less than my real worth for 
                                    the work I've done. The people there 
                                    have treated me well enough, but I'm 
                                    already looking at what comes after. 
                                    And that doesn't just mean 
                                    higher-paying jobs. The way I see it, 
                                    I have three options for how I'll make 
                                    ends meet:

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Make & foster my own 
                                            creations that'll support 
                                            me financially. Low financial 
                                            certainty, high freedom. I'd 
                                            prefer this, and it has  
                                            potential for me to focus my 
                                            energy on something that makes 
                                            the world a little better. 
                                            Meaningful work.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Freelance project commissions. 
                                            Below average financial 
                                            certainty, above average 
                                            freedom. I may do this if my 
                                            own projects aren't panning 
                                            out. Potentially stimulating & 
                                            diverse.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Another job. Financially 
                                            certain, not very freeing. If 
                                            the above aren't working or if 
                                            I need to pay into something 
                                            important, I'll put my plans on 
                                            hold & sell my time to pay 
                                            for what matters. Good pay.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                    
                                <p>
                                    In any case, it's best that I continue 
                                    working on things beyond any 
                                    employment. All these options 
                                    benefit from expanded & up-to-date 
                                    software skills. I've been working on 
                                    this site for the better part of the 
                                    last week now, so it's what's going on in 
                                    my life. I plan on making subdomains that 
                                    use different technology stacks, too, so 
                                    it'll expand my horizons when it comes to 
                                    creating & learning more. Practicing the 
                                    discipline to work full-time without being 
                                    told to... that's one of the big steps to 
                                    getting where I want to go.
                                    <br />
                                    A giant leap toward a great 
                                    journey!

                                    I don't really have a New Year's 
                                    resolution, but ramping up my work here 
                                    feels like the kind of change that 
                                    can count as one! it's partly just a 
                                    coincidence that I start now, and I say 
                                    "partly" because the turn of the new 
                                    year is exactly when I was offboarded from 
                                    the <small>enterprise</small> project I 
                                    was working on for Truist under Infosys. 
                                    I didn't do anything wrong, they just cut 
                                    funding from the whole project and let 
                                    everyone go, effective January 1st. Things 
                                    were uncertain for a lot of my teammates, 
                                    but I at least have some sort of plan. 
                                    Albeit, lots of people wouldn't want to 
                                    try what I'm trying, to start working on 
                                    my own Web projects and shoot for the moon.

                                    Curiosity is my great motivator in life. 
                                    I can find fulfillment in getting better 
                                    at the things I can do, as well as in 
                                    learning the things that I can't. I like 
                                    to imagine something and then research & 
                                    measure & experiment & build & fix up 
                                    mistakes & finally bring it to life. It's 
                                    part of what motivated me into STEM, and 
                                    mechanical engineering seemed to have the 
                                    widest available paths forward.  Sure 
                                    enough, after I got my bachelor of science 
                                    in mechanical engineering from Georgia 
                                    Tech, I picked up skills across several 
                                    other fields of study & practice. From 
                                    electronics & controls to communications 
                                    & management, I've welded and drafted and 
                                    supervised and wired things up and... 
                                    programmed software.

                                    I learned basic Java early on in my 
                                    education and enjoyed it so much that 
                                    <a href="https://github.com/Hernandezn/IntroToJava2013" target="_blank">I

                                    before the semester was halfway through. I 
                                    figured I didn't need to pay a college to 
                                    learn something I already enjoy.

                                    was popular enough at school and had 
                                    oddities that were just as likely to 
                                    become trends. Rather, I just wasn't 
                                    very concerned with people's opinions of 
                                    me, so I would say and do things that were 
                                    spontaneous. The professional world seeks 
                                    to crush this.
                                    In my view, the only ones whose opinions 
                                    of you matter in life are those you love 
                                    and those you work for. Ideally, you're in 
                                    both of those groups, but for most of us, 
                                    when we first start working, we need 
                                    someone else to work for so we can have a 
                                    direction to move toward. The employer's 
                                    opinion of you determines your fate. You 
                                    must be "professional," not 
                                    just in terms of your ability, but in 
                                    terms of your culture. Your behavior, your 
                                    attire
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I've honestly wanted to make this sort of 
                                    change for a long time now, and it's a lot 
                                    of my desires all coming together. It took 
                                    its rough shape when I created my 
                                    first Neocities website, but that's 
                                    only a piece of where this plan comes 
                                    from. I grew up not wanting to care what 
                                    people think and had to compromise on that 
                                    when the opinions of people in the 
                                    professional world determined if I could 
                                    put food on the table. I had to make the 
                                    regular taken-for-granted compromises of 
                                    what I could work on, when I could work, 
                                    how much I could get compensated, who has 
                                    control, how I dress, just a lot of things 
                                    that are normal if you want to be 
                                    employed. That's just how it is, and you 
                                    deal with it.
                                </p>

                                    However. If you work harder, it doesn't 
                                    mean you get paid more. If you're a better 
                                    worker, they just give you more work. And I've 
                                    learned that I work particularly hard. The 
                                    owner benefits, and that doesn't 
                                    necessarily mean you do. This isn't a 
                                    knock on capitalism; I do think it's 
                                    valuable to be able to make these 
                                    tradeoffs to offload the otherwise 
                                    complicated problem of justifying the 
                                    benefits you take from society. Rather, 
                                    it's to ask: what would it take for me to 
                                    become an owner and benefit from my work?
                                </p>

                                    Well, I need to be willing to work 
                                    without being told. I feel this already 
                                    filters out many of us, including my past 
                                    self. I need a vision for creating 
                                    something that might make people's lives a 
                                    little better. I need several hard and 
                                    soft skills: to be able to make 
                                    complicated decisions, think on my feet, 
                                    live below my means, deal with mistakes, 
                                    communicate effectively, stick to my 
                                    commitments... so many little things I at 
                                    least partly have my employment to thank 
                                    for. And I think that now, at the start of 
                                    2025, I'm finally ready :)
